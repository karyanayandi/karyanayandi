<h3>Hello, World</h3>

I'm Karyana Yandi, but you can call me Yandi or Adi.

I am a freelance full-stack developer on [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com/users/karyanayandi), specializing in headless technologies and AI-powered tools.

I also build [open-source projects](https://github.com/yopem) that provide smart, AI-enhanced alternatives to popular software solutions.

I primarily work with Go and JavaScript or TypeScript, but I also have experience with Lua, Python, and PHP.
